# APL Custom Keyboard for iOS

1.  Install the [xKeyboard App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xkeyboard-custom-keyboard/id1440245962)
99. Download the latest [APL.xkeyboard](APL.xkeyboard) in this repository
99. In xKeyboard, "Keyboards" > "+" > "Import" the .xkeyboard from your Downloads, and "APL" > "Install" it as an active keyboard
99. This involves a $4 in-app purchase for the full xKeyboard version, sorry
99. (You may want to remove the other default ones under "Installed", or add others like "Digit" > "Hexadecimal" or "Symbols")
99. Make sure xKeyboard is enabled as a custom keyboard in iOS settings - there should have been a prompt when first opening the app
99. File issues if you have any ideas for improvement :)
