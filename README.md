# APL Custom Keyboard for iOS

1. install the [xKeyboard App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xkeyboard-custom-keyboard/id1440245962)
99. download the latest `APL.xkeyboard`
99. in xKeyboard, "Keyboards" > "+" > "Import" the .xkeyboard from your Downloads, and "APL" > "Install" it as an active keyboard.
99. this involves a $4 in-app purchase, sorry
99. (you may want to remove the other default ones under "Installed", or add others like "Digit" > "Hexadecimal" or "Symbols")
99. make sure xKeyboard is enabled as a custom keyboard in iOS settings - there should have been a prompt when first opening the app
99. file issues if you have any ideas for improvement :)
